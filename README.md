# Pandora

Welcome to the Pandora project. A collection of game dev centric libs and tools. Starting from the ground-up, this project is intended as a fun space to experiment and try out new ideas. Over time, this toolbox will grow to offer a wider range of libs and features. 

In order to focus development, the libs will be created and extended only as needed by the main development project (TBD). By focusing on the immediate practical requirements of this project we can attempt to keep the scope narrow and controlled.

My main goal, initially, is to create a complete demo/sample app with a pre-defined set of goals and objectives. This allows us to prioritise development to only the essential features including (but not limited to) a build and test framework.

This work will require using tools new to many of the contributers. This is a safe-space, where people are expected to make mistakes in the process of learning. It is the responsibility of everyone to foster this spirit of learning and collaboration and to help each other.
