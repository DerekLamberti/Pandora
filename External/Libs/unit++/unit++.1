.SH NAME
\fBunit++\fB \- run a set of tests
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "unit++ [-v|--verbose] [-l|--line] [-g|--gui] [testid...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B unit++
(the usual name) is the resulting program from compiling a set of unit++
tests, and linking them with the
.B unit++(3)
library supplied main function to obtain an executable test suite.

Each test in the test tree has an id, and it is possible to start only some
of the tests by naming them in the form id1.id2.id3.

The line option (-l) will report failed assertions with source file and line
number in the format `file:line:result:message'. This resembles the output of
a compiler, and works well from inside an editor (like vim) or an integrated
development environment.

The GUI option is only available if the library was compiled with GUI
support, and the tests has actually linked the GUI stuff as well. Otherwise
the -g option will provoke an error. Otherwise it will give a Qt based GUI
that allows running of individual tests, with a nice green (or less nice red)
bar that shows success (or failure).
